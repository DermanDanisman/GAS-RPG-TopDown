 * ICombatInterface
 *
 * Lightweight gameplay interface exposing combat-related queries to decouple systems.
 * Current responsibility:
 * - Provide an Actor's level as a non-Attribute integer for calculations (e.g., MMCs).
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Using a plain virtual here (not UFUNCTION). That keeps it lightweight and allows
 *   direct C++ calls via native pointers. If you need Blueprint implementability
 *   or network RPC hooks, make it a UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent).
