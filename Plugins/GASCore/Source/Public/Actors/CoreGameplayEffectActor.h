//
// Summary:
//   A versatile world actor that applies and manages Gameplay Effects to overlapping targets.
//   It supports Instant, Duration, Periodic, and Infinite effects, with configurable
//   application/removal policies, level/scaling, and optional actor self-destruction.
//
// Design:
//   - Data-driven: designers configure an array of FCoreEffectConfig entries.
//   - Overlap-driven: call OnOverlap/EndOverlap from collision events (or manually).
//   - Tracking: Infinite effects applied by this actor are tracked per-target ASC via handles
//               to enable precise removal later.
//   - UI/Debug: emits verbose logs describing configuration and operations.
//
// Usage (typical Blueprint workflow):
//   - Place ACoreGameplayEffectActor in the level and add desired collision component(s).
//   - Configure GameplayEffects array (EffectClass, ApplicationPolicy, RemovalPolicy, etc.).
//   - Bind the collision's Begin/End overlap to OnOverlap/EndOverlap respectively.
//   - For Infinite effects, ensure each entry uses a distinct GameplayEffect class.
//
// Networking note:
//   - Applying/removing gameplay effects is typically a server-authoritative action.
//     Ensure your overlap events run on the server or route calls appropriately (e.g., via server RPC).
//
