//
// Purpose:
// - Light wrapper over UAbilitySystemComponent that exposes a simple multicast delegate
//   to forward GameplayEffect "asset tags" applied to this ASC to interested systems (e.g., UI).
//
// Why:
// - GAS GameplayEffects can carry asset tags that describe their semantics (e.g., UI.Message.HealthPotion).
// - Surfacing those tags at the moment of application allows the UI to react (toast messages, icons, sounds)
//   without coupling UI logic to effect classes/assets.
//
// Usage:
// - After initializing ASC actor info (InitAbilityActorInfo), call BindASCDelegates() once to register the hook
// - Bind to OnEffectAssetTags to receive FGameplayTagContainer whenever a GE is applied to self
//
// Replication notes:
// - The delegate fires on the instance where the application occurs. In a typical MP setup, UI belongs to
//   the owning client; ensure you fire on or route to the owning client as appropriate if needed.
