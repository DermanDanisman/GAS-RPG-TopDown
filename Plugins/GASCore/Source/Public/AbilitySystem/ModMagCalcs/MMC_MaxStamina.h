/**
 * UMMC_MaxStamina
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Compute a custom magnitude for MaxHealth as a function of:
 *   (a) a captured Attribute on the Target (Endurance), and
 *   (b) a non-Attribute property (Level) exposed via ICombatInterface on the SourceObject.
 *
 * Where it runs:
 * - GAS evaluates MMCs when the owning GameplayEffect's modifier magnitude is needed
 *   (e.g., when applying/re-applying an infinite GE, or when captured attributes update).
 *
 * Attribute capture notes:
 * - Endurance is captured from the Target. We set bSnapshot=false so the captured value
 *   is evaluated live at calculation time using the current aggregator state.
 *
 * SourceObject notes:
 * - We expect the GameplayEffectContext's SourceObject to implement ICombatInterface.
 *   The call will be null-unsafe here (by design) to catch misuse during development.
 *   Ensure the caller adds ContextHandle.AddSourceObject(SomeActorImplementingInterface).
 *
 * Tags:
 * - We pass aggregated source/target tags to the FAggregatorEvaluateParameters. This allows
 *   tag-conditional modifiers in the attribute aggregation to take effect.
 *
 * Rounding:
 * - Uses RoundHalfToEven to keep Max values integral and avoid .5 artifacts. Change/remove
 *   if you prefer fractional Max values or different rounding semantics.
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Captures are registered once in the constructor (RelevantAttributesToCapture).
 * - Calculation executes on the game thread and should be fast (no blocking or heavy allocations).
