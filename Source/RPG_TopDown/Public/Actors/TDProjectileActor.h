/**
 * ATDProjectileActor
 *
 * TopDown RPG-specific projectile actor that inherits from AGASCoreProjectile.
 * - Provides game-specific collision handling and projectile behavior.
 * - Integrates with the Gameplay Ability System for damage application and effects.
 * - Supports sphere collision detection for target acquisition and damage dealing.
 *
 * This class extends the base GAS projectile functionality with TopDown RPG-specific
 * features and collision responses tailored for overhead perspective gameplay.
 *
 * Note: Inherits from AGASCoreProjectile (the actual base class in GASCore).
 * If AGASCoreProjectileActor is intended as a separate base class, it should be
 * created first in the GASCore plugin.
