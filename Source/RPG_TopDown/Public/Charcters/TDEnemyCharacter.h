/**
 * ATDEnemyCharacter
 *
 * Enemy character class with GAS (Gameplay Ability System) and highlight interaction.
 * Inherits from ATDCharacterBase (provides Ability System, Attribute Set) and supports IHighlightInterface.
 *
 * Design:
 * - AI owns its own ASC/AttributeSet (unlike players whose ASC lives on PlayerState).
 * - Level typically lives on the character itself for AI. See GetActorLevel().
